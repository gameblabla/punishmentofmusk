The Rape of Orb√°n
=================

A short little HTML5 Javascript game that i did in 2 days after the Pegasus revelation and the anti LGBT amendments.

The game uses an internal resolution of 960x540 (improved from 480x320 like most of my older HTML5 games) and shares some code
with my Rubby Bird 100 game. (it was used as a template as i wanted to be as fast as possible)

It also uses the Canvas API still, no WebGL. (i might consider adding a WebGL backend in the future)
